FLUX | Wearable World Invents: The Connected Traveler
==================

Team: David Lee, Lance Nanek, Ibrahim Kabil, Andy Kwan, Michael Huh

This Google Android / Glass application is the culmination of a two-day project for the Wearable World Invents: The Connected Traveler Hackathon event. Entitled "FLUX", this application is catered towards VIP American Airlines' travelers, with the goal of providing them a fully automated, convenient and stress-free airport-to-flight experience. 

Building on top of iBeacon's Android Proximity Reference App, FLUX makes use of iBeacon Bluetooth modules to simulate an airport environment. It provides graphical directions for the VIP as they progress through the airport. 

Please note that pre-programmed iBeacons are required for "FLUX" to run properly.
