FLUX is a travel-related Google Android, Google Glass & web application that was developed for American Airlines at the “Wearable Worlds Invents: The Connected Traveler“ two-day hackathon event in San Francisco. 

FLUX was designed to guide American Airlines VIPs through airports and notify the VIP of any flight changes through Google Android and Glass applications. Using iBeacon sensors to simulate different parts of an airport, the information on FLUX would change accordingly depending on which area the VIP is currently located in. On the server side, American Airlines’ staff would utilize the web application to gain specific information about the VIP, as well as their current whereabouts in the airport.
